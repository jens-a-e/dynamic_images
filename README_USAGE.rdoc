== In general about options
Options should be in base given as hash. Format of keys in hash is not fixed. You can use +Symbol+ as good as +String+. There is also no difference between "-" and "_" chars.

If option accepts more arguments you can specify they in +Array+ and also in +String+. In case you choose +String+ it's necessary to seperate arguments by space char.

=== Example
These <tt>Hash</tt>es are considered as absolutelly same.
* <tt>{:vertical_align => :middle}</tt>, <tt>{'vertical_align' => 'middle'}</tt>, <tt>{"vertical-align" => :middle}</tt>, <tt>{:vertical_align => "middle"}</tt>, <tt>{:vertical_align => :middle}</tt>, etc.
* <tt>{:to_fit => [:crop, :sentences, 3, :resize]}</tt>, <tt>{:to_fit => "crop sentences 3 resize"}</tt>, <tt>{'to-fit' => "crop sentences 3 resize"}</tt>, etc.

== Passing a Block
In block you can accept object to call methods on it or if you don't accept any argument, block is called in object instance.

=== Example
These examples are considered as same.
  DynamicImage.new do |img|
    img.text "<b>Warning</b>"
    img.save! "warning.png"
  end

  DynamicImage.new do
    text "<b>Warning</b>"
    save! "warning.png"
  end
